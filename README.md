This project is about classifying plant images. The dataset used for creating the model consists of about 66000 images and can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G7eDJEfuuYzh62rZ26JlvSRaK-VvyKjm/view?usp=share_link. 
The labels for the images are stored in ordibehesht.csv. 
The labels are not ordered by images and must be searched by the image’s address. Don't worry the code for this is included in the project.
The ordibehesht.csv file also includes boolean tags for the images and indicate whether the labels are correct or not. For example, if the label is “sansevieria” and the tag is false, it means that the related image is not “sansevieria”. 
For now, to keep it simple, we just work with true tags.
