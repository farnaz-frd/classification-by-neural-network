This code is about plant classification. The link of images has been used for creating the model, existed here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G7eDJEfuuYzh62rZ26JlvSRaK-VvyKjm/view?usp=share_link
This file consists of about 66000 images 
Also the labels(name) of images existed in ordibehesht.csv 
Labels are not ordered by images, they must be searched by the image's address 
Don't worry the code for that existed in the code part 
The ordibehesht.csv includes labels and tags of images, which the tags are true or false and they say that the labels are correct or not. for example, if the label is "sansevieria" and the tag is false. it means that the related image is not "sansevieria". 
So for now to keep it simple we just work with true tags.
