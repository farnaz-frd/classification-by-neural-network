# classification-by-neural-network
This code is about plants classification. The link of images has been used for creating model, exicted here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G7eDJEfuuYzh62rZ26JlvSRaK-VvyKjm/view?usp=share_link  
This file consist of about 66000 images
Also the labels(name) of images existed in ordibehesht.csv 
Labels are not ordered by images, they must be seek by the image's address
Don't worry the code for that existed in code part
The ordibehesht.csv include labels and tags of images, which the tags are true or false and they say that the labels are correct or not. for example if the label is "sansevieria" and tag is false. it means that the related image is not "sansevieria".
So for now to keep it simple we just work with true tags.
